# Django_Projects
For Test and Practicing my Django

Thus far all my projects have come from django for beginner and have followed them for the most part completely hopefully soon I will be able to attempt
my own ideas 

Next of the list is the book Test-Driven Development with Python hopefully inbetween I will expand my repertoire and start attempting my own projects
